# meta-embeddings
Meta-embeddings are a probabilistic generalization of embeddings in machine learning.

## Theory
For now, all the action is theoretical and happening via the collaborative writing of a document. See theory folder. 

## Code
Hopefully we can collaborate on some open source implementations later.
