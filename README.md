# Meta-embeddings
Meta-embeddings are a probabilistic generalization of embeddings in machine learning. This project started at the [2017 JHU HLTCOE SCALE Workshop](https://hltcoe.jhu.edu/research/scale/scale-2017).

## Theory
For now, all the action is theoretical and happening via the collaborative writing of a document. See [theory](https://github.com/bsxfan/meta-embeddings/tree/master/theory) folder. 

## Code
There is already some MATLAB code to demonstrate Gaussian meta-embeddings. This code is now being used to generate some examples in the document.
